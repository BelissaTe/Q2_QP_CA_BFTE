            <p class="background_p">Mental health is one of the components that make our life. This includes our
                emotional, psychological, and social well-being. One of the main factors that affect our mental health
                is
                academics. Research has found that "increased prevalence of psychological and physical problems like
                melancholy, anxiety, nervousness, and stress-related disorders‚Äù can be brought on by excessive academic
                stress, and this can have a negative impact on academic performance. According to the website
                eric.ed.gov,
                a study that was conducted in a public national high school in the Mandaue City Division, Cebu, has
                shown
                that Mathematics is considered as one of the most difficult subjects in the among Filipino students.</p>

            <p class="background_p">Mathly Mentally Health is the perfect website that aims to help Filipino students with 
                their metal health. It mainly foccuses on academics, specifically the subject Mathematics, as 
                studies had shown that it is one of the most difficult subjects. Mathly Mentally Health offers multiple 
                courses for weekly plans or monthly plans -- either for one week or one month, depending on what
                plan the user will choose. Each of these plans will contain learning guides in pdf version that
                students can simply download for their use, as well as supplementary videos originally made by the Mathly Mentally Health
                members.</p>

                        that discuss every single topic starting from Secondary 1 Mathematics up to Secondary 6.
                        We have also created a lot of videos that will serve as a supplement for our targetted
                        High School audience. Mathly Mentally Health has a total of a 100 members so far that
                        studied/currently studying in the Philippine Science High School, Southern Mindanao
                        Campus. We make sure that each member is either a director's lister or a student who
                        has been joining Math Competitions a lot. We also have a total of 71 waitlisted volunteers,
                        who are yet to take the examination that will determine if you will become a truly valued 
                        member or not.

            <p class="initiatives_p">Mathly Mentally Health tries to execute 5 different learning techniques
                in learning
                Mathematics that each stand for the 5 major types of learners. These processes include the Read/Write learners, Visual Learners, Auditory Learners, and Kinesthetic Learners.
                For example, we have the memorization process for the Read/Write learners, where the website gives you
                short quizzes after you study the learning guides uploaded for a specific topic or concept.
                These quizzes usually involve the questions 'What?', 'Who?', and 'Why?'. The next process
                that we execute is the picture-perfect process. This basically involves diagrams, tables,
                and graphic organizers. This helps the visual student learner master the needed information
                in the form of images or visual representations.</p>
